#  BMI Calculator

## Goal

I will continue the BMI calculator project and add more features to it. I will be adding the history and persons name feature into this application. 

## What I learnt

* How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
* How to create classes and difference between classes and structs. 
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference. 
* Formatting Strings. 
* Color literals.
